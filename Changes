Revision history for Perinci-Sub-Gen-AccessTable

0.08     2012-03-22

         - Fixes for English translation.

         - build: Tweak dependency.


0.07     2012-03-22

         Rename distribution from Sub-Spec-Gen-ReadTable to
         Perinci-Sub-Gen-AccessTable.

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - Syntax of filter arguments become "F.min", "F.max", etc instead of
           the old "min_F", "max_F", etc. This results in fewer clashes with
           other arguments.

         - Rename some arguments: show_field_names -> with_field_names.

         - Rename some filter arguments, for consistency: contain -> contains,
         not -> isnt, match -> matches, lack -> lacks.

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Translation.

         - Add some filter arguments: xmin, xmax.

         No functional changes. Mark deprecation.


0.05     2011-11-23

         No functional changes. Replace Data::Sah::Util with Data::Sah.


0.04     2011-10-19

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES, ENHANCEMENTS]

         'table_data' function is now expected to return {data=>DATA, ...}
         instead of just DATA. This is to allow function to return data that is
         already filtered (by passing filtered=>1), and/or sorted (sorted=>1),
         and/or paged (paged=>1) for efficiency.


0.03     2011-08-31

         No functional changes. Updated because _parse_schema() is moved from
         Sub::Spec::Utils to Data::Sah::Util.


0.02     2011-06-13

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Generated function can search array fields.

         - Column specification clause: column_searchable (default 1) which can
           be set to false to exclude column from searching.

         - Provide search data (search_fields, search_re) in query.


0.01     2011-06-13

         First release.
